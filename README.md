Got it — here’s a concise, well‑written English description that highlights the most interesting, thoughtfully implemented parts of the project.

What makes this project stand out
A modern, polished car rental app built on Next.js 15 and React 19, designed for fast UX, clean architecture, and maintainability. Beyond the basics, it includes a handful of thoughtful details that make everyday use feel smooth.

Calendar that feels native

Inline booking calendar powered by DayPicker v9 with Monday-start weeks and custom weekday labels (SUN…SAT).
Locale-aware date formatting and guarded input behavior.
Robust popover: opens on focus/click, closes on outside click and Escape, traps focus for keyboard users, and preserves clean layout.
Clean, composable UI system

The calendar is extracted into a reusable Calendar with scoped styles (CSS Modules), so no global overrides leak into the rest of the app.
Icons are sprite-based (icons.svg) and rendered via a tiny Icon component—no heavy icon libraries.
Reusable Section and Container primitives keep page layout uniform and readable.
Built-in accessibility

Semantic lists and landmarks, sensible aria-labels, and focusable controls.
Subtle UI cues: calendar icon changes color when the whole input is hovered/focused.
Modern Next.js patterns

App Router with a clear server/client split.
Dynamic route params are correctly awaited in server components (Next 15).
Actions-based forms: intuitive booking flow without extra client handlers.
Solid data layer

TanStack Query provider ready for caching and de-duping requests.
Axios-based API client with simple, typed utilities.
Lightweight local state with Zustand (e.g., favorites), no Redux overhead.
Styling architecture that scales

CSS Modules and design tokens in :root for consistent color, border, and background usage.
Targeted DayPicker overrides only where needed; no fragile global hacks.
Minimal global CSS; components own their look.
Delightful micro-interactions

One-tap Reset with a subtle spin animation.
Price and mileage formatting utilities; smart address shortening for compact cards.
Pragmatic performance and DX

Trimmed dependencies (removed react-icons, react-calendar) to keep the bundle lean.
Fully typed with TypeScript and organized by feature for discoverability.
Tech stack: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, TanStack Query, Zustand, DayPicker v9, Axios, CSS Modules, SVG sprites.
